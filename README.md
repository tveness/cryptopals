A place to work through the CryptoPals challenges in Rust to hopefully learn things along the way!

# Build

If you have rust installed, it's very easy to run!
```
cargo run -- -c <CHALLENGE_NUMBER>
```
will run the specified challenge!

There are also a number of tests along the way to check the result of
various challenges:
```
cargo test
```
although they could take a while
